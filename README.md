# Url-shortener
This is a java project which takes in a url and shortens it using base64 algorithm.

Here, I use spring boot to use URL as a model and map it to h2 database using JPARepository.

This is an application of the MVC architecture and can be seen in the project directory structure.

I have also added a very simple UI to run the project in action.
