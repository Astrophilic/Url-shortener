# Url-shortener
This is a java project which takes in a url and shortens it using base64 algorithm.

Here, I use spring boot to use URL as a model and map it to h2 database using JPARepository.

This is an application of the MVC architecture and can be seen in the project directory structure.

I have also added a very simple UI to run the project in action.

Also lets see that the entry is inserted into the h2 on h2 console.

The h2 console can be accessed at
http://localhost:8080/h2-console/
